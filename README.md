Library Management System
Project Overview
This is a console-based Library Management System developed in Java. It provides a comprehensive set of features to manage books and members in a library, including CRUD operations, borrowing and returning books, and saving/loading data from files. The system is built using object-oriented programming principles and custom data structures without relying on built-in Java collections.

Features:
1. Add, update, and delete books and members
2. Borrow and return books with validation
3. Manual implementation of linked list data structure
4. File input/output for persistent data storage
5. Menu-driven user interface for easy interaction
6. Exception handling for robust error management

Technologies and Skills Used:
Java programming language

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

Custom linked list implementation

File I/O (reading and writing text files)

Exception handling

Version control with Git

Console-based UI design

How to Run
